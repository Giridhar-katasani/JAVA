Collections in the context of programming typically refer to data structures that allow you to store and manipulate groups of related objects.
In Java, the java.util package provides a framework of interfaces and classes for handling collections. 
Common interfaces include List, Set, Map, and their various implementations such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.

As a full-stack developer, understanding collections is important because they are widely used in both back-end and front-end development.
Here's a one-week plan with 2 hours a day to learn and practice collections in Java:

Day 1: Introduction to Collections
Topics to cover:
Overview of Collections Framework:

Understand the purpose and importance of collections.
Learn about different interfaces (List, Set, Map).
ArrayList and LinkedList:

Explore the List interface.
Understand the differences between ArrayList and LinkedList.
Hands-on exercises:
Create and manipulate ArrayLists.
Implement a program using LinkedList and compare its performance with ArrayList.
Day 2: Set Interface and HashSet
Topics to cover:
Set Interface:

Understand the Set interface and its characteristics.
Learn about common set operations (union, intersection, etc.).
HashSet:

Explore the HashSet implementation.
Understand how HashSet handles duplicates.
Hands-on exercises:
Implement a program that uses HashSet for unique element storage.
Perform set operations on two HashSet instances.
Day 3: Map Interface and HashMap
Topics to cover:
Map Interface:

Understand the Map interface and its key characteristics.
Learn about common map operations.
HashMap:

Explore the HashMap implementation.
Understand how HashMap stores key-value pairs.
Hands-on exercises:
Create a program that uses HashMap to store and retrieve key-value pairs.
Implement operations such as iterating through keys or values.
Day 4: Other Collections and Generics
Topics to cover:
Other Collection Classes:

Briefly explore other collection classes (Queue, PriorityQueue, etc.).
Understand their use cases.
Generics:

Learn about generics in Java and how they apply to collections.
Hands-on exercises:
Use a Queue or PriorityQueue for a specific scenario.
Implement a generic class or method with a collection.
Day 5: Stream API and Lambda Expressions
Topics to cover:
Stream API:

Understand the basics of the Stream API for processing collections.
Learn about intermediate and terminal operations.
Lambda Expressions:

Introduction to lambda expressions and their use in the Stream API.
Hands-on exercises:
Rewrite existing collection operations using the Stream API and lambda expressions.
Day 6: Collections Best Practices and Performance
Topics to cover:
Best Practices:

Learn best practices for using collections in Java.
Understand immutability and when to use it.
Performance Considerations:

Explore performance considerations when working with collections.
Understand factors affecting time and space complexity.
Hands-on exercises:
Review and refactor existing code to adhere to best practices.
Analyze and optimize the performance of a collection-based operation.
Day 7: Project Integration and Advanced Topics
Topics to cover:
Integration with Projects:

Learn how to integrate collections into larger projects.
Advanced Topics (Optional):

Explore advanced topics like concurrent collections, custom comparators, etc.
Hands-on exercises:
Integrate collection usage into a small project or application.
Optionally explore and experiment with advanced collection features.
Remember, practice is key to mastering collections in Java. Feel free to adjust the plan based on your progress and interests.
